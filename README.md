# Screenclip

A lightweight system tray application built with the Tauri framework, utilizing Rust for backend operations and Vanilla JS for the frontend. The application leverages the DXGI Desktop Duplication API to provide low-latency, direct access to desktop frames, allowing users to video record selected areas of their screen similar to the snipping tool.

## üåü FEATURES
- High-Efficiency Captures: Utilizes DXGI Desktop Duplication API for high framerate recordings.

- Optimized for Windows: Crafted specifically for the Windows environment to ensure minimal latency and high performance captures.

## üõ†Ô∏è TO DO

1. [ ] Incorporate low-level window configurations:

   1- Use `SetPropW()` from the Windows API to [prevent Shell's fullscreen auto-detection](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7328#issuecomment-1632359368) and ensure taskbar z-order maintains its position even when the window occupies the entire screen.

   2- Use `SetWindowLongPtrA()` from the Windows API to add the `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` extended style to the Tauri window. This [prevents videos or streams from pausing](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7401#issuecomment-1632395258) when a window covers the entire screen.

   3- Using [Windows API](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3565) disable window opening/closing transitions for the region selection window. 

2. [X] Encode raw frames into H264 data.

3. [X] Mux the H264 data to mp4.

4. [ ] Unspaghettify codebase (code refactoring).

5. [ ] Optimize screen capture via DXGI Desktop Duplication API for performance (minimize frame skip).

6. [ ] Optimize frame encoding for performance (minimize unnecessary operations).

7. [ ] Implement control of encoder settings from front-end (CRF, Bitrate, Preset, Tune, Profile, and enable Fast Start for playback).

8. [ ] Implement audio capture.

9. [ ] For video capture force height and width region selection area to snap to even numbers (because YUV420 pixel format does not offer precise dimensions).
    
10. [ ] Implement persistent settings (utilize [tauri-plugin-store](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-store) for persistent key value storage).

11. [ ] Implement customizable hotkeys (video capture Start/Stop, screenshot and quickshot).

12. [ ] Implement a recording controls that's always below the region selection area that provides the option to mute/unmute audio, button to select the entire screen and a record button.

13. [ ] Implement a recording widget that shows elapsed time and a button to stop recording (escape hotkey should also stop recording by default) 

14. [ ] While recording remove the crosshair at the center.

15. [ ] Implement an option to enable snapping video region selection area to common resolutions (144p, 240p, 360p).

16. [ ] Support hardware encoding NVEnc and AMF (Nvidia/AMD GPU encoding).

17. [ ] Implement an option to send image capture to Excalidraw before cropping for sketching.

18. [ ] Show height and width of selected area.  

## üë∑ BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
### Using MSYS2 environment on Windows
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
2. Install Tauri [prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) (C++ Build Tools, WebView2 and Rust).
3. Install [MSYS2 MinGW64](https://www.msys2.org/#installation).
4. Follow FFmpeg [build instructions](https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg/wiki/Notes-on-building#gnu-toolchain) for the GNU toolchain.
5. When you launch MinGW64, run `pacman -Syu` a few times to update, then run the command `export PATH="/c/Program Files/nodejs/:$PATH"` to add Node.js to the PATH environment variable.
6. Clone this repo: `git clone -b dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/0Ky/screenclip.git` (must use dev branch and include submodules).
7. Once you're in the cloned folder run `npm install`, then `npm run tauri dev` to run in development mode or `npm run tauri build` to build in release mode.
