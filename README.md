A lightweight system tray application built with the Tauri framework, utilizing Rust for backend operations and Vanilla JS for the frontend. The application leverages the DXGI Desktop Duplication API to provide low-latency, direct access to desktop frames, allowing users to video record selected areas of their screen similar to the snipping tool.

## üåü FEATURES
- High-Efficiency Captures: Utilizes DXGI Desktop Duplication API for high framerate recordings.

- Optimized for Windows: Crafted specifically for the Windows environment to ensure minimal latency and high performance captures.
