First of all, thank you for considering contributing! Your help and expertise can make this project better. Before you get started, please review the guidelines below to ensure smooth collaboration and contribution.

## Contributing

Whether you're a veteran developer or a newcomer, we appreciate all contributions. Each addition or modification helps make the project more robust and beneficial for its users.

1. Begin by forking the `dev` branch of the `screenclip` repository. If you've previously forked it, make sure your fork is synchronized and updated with the latest changes.

2. In your fork, create and switch to a new branch named `<branch_name>`. This is where you'll make your changes.

3. Carefully implement the changes or enhancements you have in mind on this branch. Remember to frequently commit to keep a record of your progress.

4. Once you're satisfied with your changes, push them to `<branch_name>` on your forked repository.

5. To contribute back to the project, all changes should be proposed through a Pull Request. Therefore, create a Pull Request from your `<branch_name>` to the `'dev'` branch of the main `screenclip` repository for review and potential merging.

## Before filing an issue:

1. **Replicate the Problem**: Always try to reproduce the issue before reporting it. This ensures it's a consistent problem and not just a one-time occurrence.
   
2. **Check for Existing Features**: Before suggesting a new feature, make sure it's not already in the [TO-DO](https://github.com/0Ky/screenclip/blob/main/TO-DO.md) list.
   
3. **Check Current Pull Requests for Bugs**: If you've found a bug, please check the current pull requests. Someone might have already submitted a fix.
   
4. **Check Current Pull Requests for Features**: Similarly, if you're suggesting a feature, ensure no one else is already working on it by checking the current pull requests.

## Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Ensure Your Feature is Unique**: It's essential to scan the codebase before adding a feature to make sure it doesn't already exist.
   
2. **Look for Similar Pull Requests**: Before submitting a new pull request, browse through the existing ones or open an issue (or update an existing one) containing something you wish to contribute. This avoids duplicate efforts where multiple contributors work on the same feature or fix.
